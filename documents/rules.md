# Rules

## Course rules

### Arrive on time

Arrive **before scheduled start time**. If you're still in the kitchen making coffee when a workshop is supposed to begin you aren't on time, you're late. The mentors will not wait for everyone to be present before starting in the morning.

Let your cohort or the course facilitator know in advance if you're going to be away. Lots of people are giving freely of their time and knowledge to make FAC possible and giving up other commitments to be here.

### Share the space

You are sharing a space with the rest of your cohort, the mentors, FAC staff and plenty of people working in Space4. Make sure you respect everyone else's right to have access to a clean tidy kitchen and bathroom.

Tidy up after yourself (at least!). Wash up your mugs and dishes straight away. Don't leave old food to go mouldy in the fridge. Clear your desk at the end of each day so it's ready for someone to use in the morning.

### Move around

Try to sit at a different desk each day. You'll usually be pairing with the person next to you; it's important to get experiencing working with everyone on the cohort.

### 20-minute rule

Struggle is good, but not too much of it. It's important to get used to not knowing how to do something, and to practice finding out for yourself (e.g. figuring it out with your pair or googling). If you cannot solve a problem within 20 minutes, then stop and ask a mentor for help.

### No frameworks

For the first 8 weeks of the course, we stick to vanilla JavaScript. That means no frontend frameworks like Bootstrap, jQuery and friends. We want you to build your fundamental skills before learning higher-level abstractions.

Understanding the basics will help you understand what problems frameworks were built to solve. This will let you make more effective judgements on which technologies to use in future. It will also give you the flexibility to switch between technologies, as the popularity of each one can shift.

## Social rules

Our social rules help create a friendly environment that is conducive to learning. We want everyone to feel comfortable sharing ideas and occasionally being wrong.

These rules are important, but they aren't severe like code-of-conduct violations. It's likely everyone will slip up and break a social rule: you aren't a bad person if you do. If someone points this out apologise, reflect for a second and move on.

### No "well-actually"s

Try not to add an irrelevant correction to a conversation. Software engineers tend to care about being very specific and correct. This is a good trait when writing code, but makes for awkward conversation. Nobody wants to have to preface a short anecdote with pages of legalese and clarifications. An unnecessary interruption can throw off the person speaking and make them uncomfortable sharing further.

> Bill: "Actually tomatoes are a fruit!"

### No feigning surprise

Don't act surprised when someone doesn't know something. This will make that person feel bad for not knowing, and less likely to ask questions in the future.

> Jane: "What does `querySelector` do?"
>
> Bill: "You've never used `querySelector`?!"

### No backseat driving

Don't chuck advice at people if you're not part of a conversation or working on a problem with someone. You might overhear a pair who are stuck on something and want to help, but it's likely you're missing lots of context (and you don't know what they've already tried). You might also be depriving them of the learning opportunity of figuring something out for themselves. It's also rude to jump into a conversation without asking first.

### No subtle-isms

Subtle-isms are subtle expressions of racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other kinds of bias and prejudice. Although they may be small things they make people feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. Remember that (especially if you are in a privileged majority) that [microaggressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression) add up. Your small offhand comment might be piled on top of a whole day of slights.

We want to create an environment where everyone feels like they belong. Overt, intentional prejudice is a code-of-conduct violation and should be reported.

Please also avoid bringing discussions of highly-charged topics into the space. What may be an interesting intellectual problem for you could be the daily lived experience of someone else.
